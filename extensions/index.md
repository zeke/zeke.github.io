I've been trying out [Beaker](https://beakerbrowser.com/), an experimental new
web browser built on Electron. It looks and feels like a typical web browser,
but what makes it unique is its

Beaker brings concepts from BitTorrent into the browser. It has built-in support for [dat](https://datproject.org/) a protocol that enables anyone to publish a site
immediately, independently, and for free, using only their browser.

For the most part, this transition from Chrome to Beaker has been easy. The UI is essential the same. But there's a snag: Beaker doesn't have support for extensions, and probably won't any time soon.
