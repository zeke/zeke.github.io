Hello, loved one. If you're reading this it's because I mailed you a 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neodymium">neodymium</a> magnet, one of the strongest types of magnets
on Earth. If I didn't send you a magnet, you can
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01IAFIVQQ">buy your own</a> for
under ten dollars.

Your new magnet was probably made in China, where 95% of the minerals used to
make magnets are mined and processed. The neodymium is coated with copper and 
nickel to prevent breaking or chipping, but it's still fragile so take care 
not to drop it. If you do break it though, there's no need to fret: now you 
have two magnets!

Your magnet is meant to be a reminder of the natural wonder of our universe, 
and the very real magic that is all around us. It's also meant to be a symbol 
of our Earth, which is itself a giant magnet.

The Earth contains electrically conducting materials like iron, and the movement
of these materials from the Earth's rotation generates a magnetic field. 
This field extends tens of thousands of miles into space and protects the 
Earth from the charged particles of solar wind and cosmic rays that would 
otherwise strip away the layers of atmosphere that protect us from 
ultraviolet radiation.

## Practical Uses

We use magnets every day without thinking about it. They are essential to
the function of speakers, headphones, hard drives, cell phones, motors, 
electric guitar pickups, and all kinds of other stuff.
