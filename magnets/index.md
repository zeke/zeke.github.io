Hello, loved one. If you're reading this it's most likely because I mailed you a 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neodymium">neodymium</a> magnet, one of 
the strongest types of magnets on Earth. If I didn't send you a magnet, you can
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01IAFIVQQ">buy your own</a> for
under ten dollars.

Your magnet was probably made in China, where 95% of the minerals used to
make magnets are mined and processed. The neodymium is coated with copper and 
nickel to prevent breaking or chipping, but it's still fragile so take care 
not to drop it. If you do break it though, there's no need to fret: now you 
have two magnets!

Carry your magnet in your pocket and notice the things you stick to, or that
stick to you.

# The Earth

Your magnet is a symbol of the Earth, which is itself a giant magnet. The Earth's
core is filled with electrically conductive materials like iron, and its 
rotation generates a magnetic field that extends tens of thousands of miles into space. 
This field protects us from charged particles of solar wind and cosmic rays 
that would otherwise strip away the layers of atmosphere that protect us from ultraviolet radiation.

## Energy

Your magnet is energetic. Magnetism and electricity are like two sides of the 
same coin: a spinning magnet creates an electric current, and conversely a 
current traveling through a loop of wire creates a magnetic field.

This fundamental principle of nature has only recently been exploited by humans, 
within the last 150 years or so. Our discoveries about how to collect and 
distribute electrical power may have been the single most significant factors
in the development of our modern world.

## Solstice

Our year is designated by the time it takes the Earth to make a trip around the
Sun. The earth is tilted. That is to say its rotational axis is off-kilter 
from its orbital rotation around the sun by around 23 degrees. This axial tilt
gives us variable amounts of daylight throughout the year.

Etymologically speaking, the _solstice_ is the day the sun stands still. For 
folks living on Earth's northern hemisphere, the winter solstice is our shortest
day. In agrarian times, the days following the solstice were  a celebrated of 
the sun's gradual and measurable retreat to the south. The sun's movement is a 
physically embodied signal of longer, warmer days to come and the start of a 
new cycle.

## Electromagnetism

The sun is a nuclear fusion reactor. Atomic particles collide violently, emitting
a form of energy we call electromagnetic radiation. The electromagnetic 
spectrum is the range of frequencies of electromagnetic radiation.

What we call "light" is actually just a slice of the electromagnetic spectrum.
Our eyes are able to perceive a sliver of this radiation as visible light.
But our cell phones, computers, wifi routers, televisions, remotes, and 
microwaves are all using this same form of energy to transmit and receive 
signals, only along frequencies of the electron spectrum that our eyes cannot 
perceive.

Snakes can see in the dark. This is not magic. Their eyes are more sensitive to 
heat emitted at a different part of the electromagnetic spectrum.

## Practical Uses

If your find the relationship of electricity and magnetism unfathomable or
bewildering, you may take comfort in knowing that your magnet also has many 
simple and practical quotidian applications.

We use magnets every day without thinking about it. They are essential to
the function of compasses, speakers, hard drives, cell phones, motors, 
electric guitar pickups, and all kinds of other stuff.
