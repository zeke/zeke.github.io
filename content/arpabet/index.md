It uses Carnegie Mellon University Pronouncin Dictionary, a list of over 125,000 words transcribed into Arpabet, a phonetic transcription code developed by Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA) as a part of their Speech Understanding Project (1971â€“1976). It represents each phoneme of General American English with a distinct sequence of ASCII characters.
