[Swagger](http://swagger.io/) is a specification and open-source framework for describing, producing, consuming, and visualizing RESTful web services with JSON. I created Swagger while building [wordnik.com](https://wordnik.com). Our team needed a tool to help make our APIs easier to document, understand, and use. In the four years since its creation, a [large and active community](https://github.com/swagger-api) has developed around Swagger, and people are continuing to find new and interesting ways to incorporate it into their JSON webservice implementations.

In 2015, Amazon Web Services introduced the [Amazon API Gateway](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-apigateway-importer) with built-in support for Swagger APIs.

Swagger is also supported by [Runscope](https://www.runscope.com/docs/api-testing/importing#radar-export).
