I'm in Tokyo for the second annual Electron Mini-Summit, a convergence
of people working on the [Electron] project. This page is a place for me to 
take notes about things I've found in the city.

## Bike Rental

[docomo-cycle.jp](http://docomo-cycle.jp/) is a bike share program. 
(Docomo is a mobile phone operator in Japan, and apparently they've
invested in exchange for their logo and colors on every bike.)
There are stations all over the city where you can pick up a bike, then park 
it elsewhere. The are options to rent by the hour, day, or month.

The bikes are equipped with battery-powered electric motors that give a 
nice assist as you ride. The motor kicks in only when you're pedaling, so it 
feels very natural. Just like riding a bike, but easier.

If you end up renting one of these bikes, here are a few tips:

- Signing up may be easier on your phone than on your computer.
- When the kickstand is down, there's a lock that snaps into place. You have to flip the lock open first before the kickstand will go back up.
- I'm staying in the Shinagawa area, and have seen unlocked bikes all over the 
place, so I'm assuming that theft is relatively uncommon. If you end stopping 
somewhere with no nearby stations, it's probably safe to leave the bike 
unattended for a time. Use your judgement!
- When returning a bike, all you have to do is lock the back wheel.


Here a [Google map of all the stations](https://goo.gl/n66eGZ):

## Food

A few places I've tried and liked:

[T's TanTan Tokyo Station](http://www.nre.co.jp/Portals/0/shop/tantan/) - Clean 
and delicious vegan ramen. Tokyo station is very busy, and a great place for 
people-watching.

[Kura Sushi Shinagawa Ekimae](http://www.kura-corpo.co.jp/store/detail/220) - 
Cheap and good conveyor-belt sushi. Grab food off the conveyor belt or 
order something specific using the tablet at your table. Every five plates
enters you in a video lottery with prizes!

[The City Bakery](http://www.thecitybakery.jp/) - In Shinagawa station. Good espresso drinks, delicious baked goods like [cubic brioche](https://photos.app.goo.gl/v6D3Ba7jWmNVtsql1), international music. Sit down or get stuff to go.

## Map

I'm saving spots on a Google Map as I go:
